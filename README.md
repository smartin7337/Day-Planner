This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. It's a calendar loaded in the browser that allows the user to mark/create events for different hours of the day and save them. The past hours are shaded in grey, the current hour is in red and the future hours are in green. It focuses heavily on if/else conditions to move between past/present/future and the local time while accessing local storage.
